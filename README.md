Online-Zoo 

I have implemented this user-friendly project as a hometask during RSschool Front-end Development courses.   
The task was to build a static webpage using HTML, CSS according to Figma markup https://www.figma.com/file/2oPX1vQO4ZHgSv2ikDsPSd/online-zoo-3-weeks-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1&t=xWH8FWZvMNkrowOd-0

One of the requirements was to make it PixelPerfect.
I have faced the challenge creating the bar to choose the donation amount. I have implemented it using radio buttons.
